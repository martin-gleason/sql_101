# Tidy Data Principles
.pull-left[
### Academic Terms
1. Each variable is atomic 

2. Each variable forms a column

3. Each observation froms a row

4. Each type of observational unit forms a table
]
.pull-right[
### Real Life Examples
1. Seperating first and last names

2. First Name Column, DOB Colums

3. Martin, Gleason, 7/14/197

4. Birthday Table

# Excercise #1: Tidy This Table
```{r clerks_table, echo = FALSE}

clerks[1:20, 1:4] %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options= c("responsive","striped")) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "75%")
```

# Excercise #1 Results

.pull-left[
1. Each variable is atomic 

2. Each variable forms a column

3. Each observation froms a row

4. Each type of observational unit forms a table
]

.pull-right[
1. Names are not atomic

2. Missing First Name, Last Name

3. More than one "observation"

4. It is one table. Should it be?

# Database vs Spreadsheet: 
##Compltely Oversimplified

.pull-left[
* **Spreadsheets:**
Collect and track whatever you want however you want.

* **Database:**
Stricter rules about what can go where, but faster AND it tracks relationships

# Excercise 2: Bike Stores
.pull-left[![:scale 110%](../img/SQL-Server-Sample-Database.png)]
.pull-right[
**Think of tracking a bike purchase using a spreadsheet:**

  * Customer info
  * Store order
  * What they orderd
  * Delivery method
  * Making a return
